# Basics of Videography Quiz

## Description

This quiz is meant to test a user's knowledge of the basics of videography. The purpose of building this quiz was to get more practice in the usage and application of JavaScript. The idea of this project was to apply JSON and localStorage knowledge to our JavaScript files.

If I had more time, I would have added more functionality (as seen in the commented lines within HTML, CSS, and JS). I did not fully complete the high score page as I spent too much time completing the CSS for this project.

This project was a great lesson in time management. I have learned to allocate more time to JS rather than CSS. This will help me complete minimum acceptance criteria in the future before moving on to design.
